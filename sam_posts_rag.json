What started as executive coaching for the CEO quickly revealed a deeper issue:\n\nThe leadership team was in chaos\n\nFriction between the CFO and CRO was rising\n\nMilestones were slipping\n\nA $12 M revenue target was floating off into the abyss\n\nThat meant a projected $3 M gap if things did not change\u2014and fast.\n\nHourly pricing versus value pricing\nI could have charged hourly. That would probably have totaled around $30 K\u2013$40 K but it would have completely devalued the real transformation they needed:\n\nTeam coaching across the board\n\nLive observation of key meetings\n\nMonthly one-on-one coaching for each executive\n\nReal metrics, real measurement, real accountability\n\nThis was not a time-for-cash job. It was systemic change at the core of the business. So we priced the value, not the hours.\n\nThe result\nThe adrenaline is still alive and kicking whenever I quote big numbers! We set the price at $75 K\u2014and they said yes. Why? Because the cost of not solving it was $3 M.\n\nA reminder for HR consultants and executive coaches\n\nYou are not a cost centre\n\nYou are a strategic investment\n\nYour work is invaluable and has real impact\n\nReady to move from hourly to value-based pricing?\nDM me and let\u2019s build your next $75 K package. \ud83e\udd70",

Especially if you\u2019ve just left corporate and you haven\u2019t got a Scooby where to start.\n\nLet me break it down for you in a few posts this week.\n\nStep 1: Map out every element of your service\nAnd I mean ALL of it!\n\nThe research\n\nYour thinking time\n\nThe chats with other consultants (think about those corridor conversations back in your corporate days)\n\nInternal comms and strategy building\n\nDay-to-day client comms \u2013 emails, calls, \u201ccan you just \u2026\u201d\n\nExecution and delivery\n\nMeasuring progress and reporting back\n\nManaging the client, the plan, the people, and the outcomes\n\nAdmin. All. The. Admin.\n\nStakeholder wrangling (obviously)\n\nStep 2: Add 30%\nThat\u2019s your new baseline \u2013 it covers all the small day-to-day tasks that slip into client management and the eleventy-billion \u201ccan you just \u2026\u201d requests. What feels simple to you took years to master.\n\nNow look at your hourly rate. If it was $175 when you started, bump it up to $195. See the difference? (By the way, I\u2019d love for you to bet on $250 an hour!)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the outcome\nDoes that price reflect the actual value your client will receive? Consider:\n\nEfficiency\n\nRetention\n\nRevenue\n\nPeace of mind\n\nLess grey hair, more sleep at night!\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t match, adjust accordingly.\n\nFor today:\nStart by writing everything out. You\u2019ll be amazed at what you\u2019ve been undercharging for.\n\nTomorrow I\u2019ll dig into how to think about outcomes and make sure your pricing matches the real impact you bring.",

If you\u2019re just starting out on your HR consultancy journey and feel stuck on what to charge, here\u2019s a starting point I often recommend:\n\nStep 1: Set an hourly rate\nFor your first couple of clients, billing by the hour is fine. It gives you space to build confidence and experience. A good starting range is $150 to $250 per hour, depending on your skillset and comfort level. Let\u2019s use $150 per hour as a benchmark, the lowest point I suggest while you master the art of selling.\n\nStep 2: Calculate what you actually need\nIf you want to replace a $120,000 salary, divide 120,000 by 150. That equals 800 billable hours per year.\n\nStep 3: Break it down by week\nAssuming 48 working weeks, 800 hours divided by 48 equals about 16.7 billable hours per week. That works out to roughly four clients at four to five hours each. Totally doable.\n\nKey reminders\nThis is just the start of your journey. Once you\u2019ve landed your first few clients, productise and package your services so you are selling value, not time.\n\nIf you feel confident doing value-based pricing from the outset, even better. These principles still apply and give you a strong foundation.\n\nThose billable hours do not include admin, marketing, sales time, financial planning, or your own development. Building systems and boundaries early on is key.\n\nWant help creating a revenue plan that does not burn you out? Let\u2019s chat. I coach HR consultants through their first $250,000 and beyond with clarity, confidence, and clients they love.",

I have scaled multiple HR consultancy businesses and built big revenue. I love helping HR consultants dream big on their terms meet, exceed and support them to reach their goals. But I also believe in asking smart questions, not finger-clicking like I\u2019m on Dragon\u2019s Den.\n\nWhy I walked away\n\u2022 Zero commercial logic behind the question\n\u2022 No real curiosity about my goals\n\u2022 Finger clicking?

Hit the number.\nThen post a shiny \u201chere\u2019s how I did it\u201d recap in 90 days.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how I want to lead.\n\nSo here it is, messy, real, in-progress:\n\nI\u2019m breaking down my exact plan into a 7-day sprint and sharing it in real-time so you can build your own version alongside me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about being perfect.\n\nI\u2019m not. I\u2019ll mess up, fumble, and probably change my mind once or twice.\n\nBut every mistake? It\u2019s just another step forward. Another data point. Another day of momentum.\n\nIf you join this sprint, you\u2019ll walk away with one thing:\n\n\u2705 A clear, sellable service plus a simple system to generate leads for it in 90 days or less.\n\nNot a funnel. Not a \u201cvisibility hack.\u201d\n\nJust focused action that moves the needle.\n\nToday (Sunday), my CEO Reset looks like this:\n\nI'll focus on just ONE service to sell\n\nFinalise my lead magnet (I want to create a sense of urgency without the ick)\n\nBuild my first 150-contact list (yes, with good old Excel)\n\nAnd here\u2019s the best part. I\u2019m not doing it alone. I'd love to do it with you.\n\nI\u2019m hosting a live Accountability Sprint Call on Tuesday and you\u2019re invited:\n\nTuesday (this week)\n\ud83d\udd54 5pm UK / Midday EST / 9am PST\n\nWe\u2019ll work together to:\n\nChoose YOUR one service\n\nStart YOUR prospect list\n\nSet YOUR 90-day revenue goal (one that excites you, not terrifies you)\n\nYou don\u2019t need the perfect offer or branding. I see that as an evolution.\n\nJust the courage to show up and take one step.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be right there doing it with you, nerves and all.\n\nDrop a \u201cyes please\u201d below and I\u2019ll DM you the link plus a prep sheet to get started.\n\nOthers are already joining. Come be part of something real, imperfect, and powerful.\n\nLet\u2019s build this runway together in June. You in?! \u2764\ufe0f",
