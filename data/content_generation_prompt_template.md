## EXAMPLE EXCELLENT POST (USE THIS STYLE):

"As an HR consultant, I'm sure you are used to going into present your services to prospects. How often have you had that awkward moment where you ask 'Please let me know if you have any questions.' You don't know what to do with yourself as that tumbleweed of silence turns into an awkward moment.

How about asking:
- 'How can I best support you from here?'
- 'What do you feel I didn't cover that would be helpful for you today?'

For some reason - that 'Any questions' line - just seems to be super awkward.

This shows humor, it shows I've been there and understanding it - it also gives 2-3 examples of how to ask the same question but differently to encourage engagement and to move the conversation one step closer to a potential sale.

## EXAMPLE GOOD POST (SECONDARY):

"I recently worked with an HR director who was terrified of leaving her 'safe' corporate salary. She'd been thinking about consulting for months but couldn't pull the trigger.

Sound familiar?

Here's what changed everything for her: she stopped focusing on what she'd lose and started focusing on what she'd gain. Freedom. Flexibility. The chance to actually make an impact.

Within 8 months, she'd replaced her corporate income and was working with clients she actually enjoyed.

The lesson? Your fear of leaving corporate is valid. But staying stuck because of that fear is optional.

What's really holding you back from making the leap?

## EXAMPLE BAD POST (AVOID):

"Are you a #hrleader, #hrdirector, #hrmanager or #compliance consultant looking to grow? Check out this link to see what our clients say about us. https://lnkd.in/eJY_vnK #hrconsultants #hrleaders #hrmanagers #hrcommunity"

**Why it's bad**: Generic corporate language, link drop without context, too many hashtags, no personal voice, no value provided.
